### Food demand forecasting under Foundations of Data Analytics

In his project we have used XGBoost and LightGBM algorithms to predict the
number of orders for each city and each recipe and Compared the results with
the real values.
• We compared these two algorithms to find out which algorithm can
efficiently and accurately determine the number of orders.
• Acquired knowledge in Data analytics using python.

### Baby monitering system under Embedded System Design

The proposed system uses Pir, humidity , temperature , heartbeat , sound and
air quality sensors to monitor the baby. We have given every sensor a certain
range.
• If anything abnormal is observed, Gsm will send the message to
parents/guardians and LED,LCD Display, alarm will be activated.
• Acquired skills in embedded C language and hardware used in this project.

### Gesture Controlled  Vehicle using OpenCV under Wireless and Mobile Communication

In this project we have used openCV library and Mediapipe framework in
python to detect both hand and head gestures. When our system’s camera
detects gesture, it’ll process the image and verifies with predetermined
positions for left, right, back and acceleration.
• Accordingly the system will display the output.
• Acquired skills in using openCV and Mediapipe.

### Detection of diabetic retinopathy as capstone project

In this project we have classified DR image into 5 different classes based on the level of decease. We have used Resnet18 architecture with swish activation function to accomplish the desired accuracy and recall values.
• We compared this architecture with some of the standard architectures (simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), MobileNet-v2, VGG-16) to find out how this architecture is efficient.
• Acquired knowledge in Image Processing tasks and various Deep learning
Architectures, Tensorflow, Keras.
