Let’s talk about mac terminal. So, generally Mac comes with basic and boring terminal(zsh).

For a long time I didn’t know the power we can leverage using zsh. I looked in to youtube for terminal setup found few amazing tutorials to make my terminal flexible as well as aesthetic.

Almost all of the tutorials explained the same thing:

- Installing Iterm2 and oh my zsh framework
- A powerlevel10k theme
- Configure .zshrc file to your own needs such as auto completions & few aliases….

Then I made my terminal mildly transparent to make it look more charming.


So, since I’m addicted to aesthetics of my terminal I wanted learn vim so that I can stick with it while coding and jotting down ideas.

Initially it seemed worthless effort. But after few weeks of “trying and leaving”, one fine day I determined to learn vim. The basic idea here is you should be able to finish your entire time in vim without lifting your fingers on your keyboard. I wanted to list out the commands that I use, but it’s pretty useless, you can find better documentation [here](https://vim.rtorr.com/). 

Apart from using :vsp to vertically split screen to compare 2 files at the same time, I configured (aliased) few plugins that I use often.
To access nerdtree press F1, you can toggle using ctrl+w or you can also use mouse.
If you add #!/usr/bin/env python3 at the beginning of python file you can click F2 to run it or else you should run with :! command.

I recently need to download my telegram chat history. When I’ve downloaded it gave me all these html files. 

But I really don’t wanna store every file. I want one single html file with all the data.

So run a python command to get me the names as I desired.

Then I use cat command on my mac terminal to concatenate all the files.


I know it is very basic thing that anyone could do without any proper coding knowledge. But I’m just saying you can’t search for better tool to combine 100s of html files at once.
