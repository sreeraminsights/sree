(planning to use neovim or lazyvim in the future).

**HandBrake** plays a crucial role whenever I want to convert videos into various formats while controlling bitrate, resolution and also enables me to compress my videos without loosing quality.

### Arc **and Tor (Browsing)**

I occasionally use **Tor** for secure and private browsing. It offers anonymity by routing internet traffic through a global network of relays.

Notion is a space where I plan capture thoughts, manage projects.
